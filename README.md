# Vertex-Breeze-Metacity
A fork from the vertex theme with a touch of KDE's breeze.

The original Vertex theme: https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme

The KDE folks: https://github.com/KDE

firefox-hide-caption-titlebar-plus: https://github.com/Javier-DarthPalpatine/firefox-hide-caption-titlebar-plus


# Installation:

Download the files and move the Vertex-Breeze folder to ~/.themes or do this:

```
cd ~/.themes
git clone https://gitlab.com/RaitaroH/Vertex-Breeze-Metacity.git
mv Vertex-Breeze-Metacity/Vertex-Breeze/ ~/.themes/
```
You can also move the chrome folder to your firefox profile IF you are using the **firefox-hide-caption-titlebar-plus** addon.

Now simply change the metacity theme from your desktops' settings.
