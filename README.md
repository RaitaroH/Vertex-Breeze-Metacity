# Vertex-Breeze-Metacity
A fork from the vertex theme with a touch of KDE's breeze.

The original Vertex theme: https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme

The KDE folks: https://github.com/KDE
 
 

#Installation:

Download the files and move the Vertex-Breeze folder to ~/.themes or do this:

``cd ~/.themes && git clone https://github.com/RaitaroH/Vertex-Breeze-Metacity.git && mv Vertex-Breeze-Metacity/Vertex-Breeze/ ~/.themes/``

Now simply change the metacity theme from your desktops' settings.
